With this loan, I plan on fully paying off my high interest cards and then dispersing the remainder across any remaining balances.  Within three years, I will pay off my Lending Club loan and only carry a student loan debt.    Recent changes in the economy have shown me that carrying credit card debt is just a pointless thing to do.  I want to be rid of it once and for all.  I'd rather pay interest to a person or entity who can benefit from my payments over a huge corporation that may fold or need a bail-out tomorrow.    About myself:  I am a single girl working in public healthcare.  Economic changes have definitely cemented my job security, but have not been so great for the patients we serve.  Each week, more and more people come through the door after losing their insurance coverage.  It is rewarding to know that we offer a place that they can come to receive quality, low-cost healthcare and be treated with dignity and respect.    I rent, so a home equity loan is out for me.  However, I am very responsible with my bills and rent.  I have been in this neighborhood for 7 years and I work here as well.

I will limit most personal information due to privacy concerns.  I know this is social lending but I would think most people would limit themselves to the information that is needed during a normal bank loan application. 557443 added on 10\/16\/09 > CREDIT HISTORY: ----------------- 01\/06\/2009  FICO Scores:  TransUnion: 751 Equifax: 737 Experian: 749   04\/08\/2009  FICO Scores:  TransUnion: 756 Equifax: 737  FAKO Score: Experian PLUS: 767   06\/29\/2009  TransUnion: 741 Equifax: 736  FAKO Score: Experian PLUS: 748   * The reason behind the lower scores in June was because the first of May I bought an addition vehicle because the ONE vehicle we had was too small for my family.  We had been driving ONE small vehicle for the last 3 years which has been paid off for the last 7 years (wife side).   I sold mine because it was a 2 seater sports card. :( 557443 added on 10\/16\/09 > OCCUPATION: ------------  It states where I work and the state I live in. I will not state my job title or official description because you could easily identify me with information via Google or by calling my employer. I will state vaguely that I work supporting computer systems. 557443 added on 10\/16\/09 > BUDGET: ------------  My annual salary is $61,200. I get paid biweekly. My logic is that I make $4,707 a month calculating for 2 biweekly paychecks not 2 and 1\/12th biweekly paychecks.  My mortgage payment is $748.71 but I've been paying over and ahead to keep a cushion. Every two weeks at the beginning of each year I pay the mortgage, so by the time the month of August rolls around I'm a month ahead because of biweekly paychecks.  I pay $850.10 a month on my mortgage. That is $784.71 divided by 12 plus $748.71. $784.71 \/ 12 = $65.39 + $784.71 = $850.10 So I can make 13 equivalent payments a year with only paying 12 and it is less interest in the long run this way.   I pay $380 a month for the auto loan and interest on that loan is 4.25%. I don't pay extra on the auto loan because the interest paid is so low compared to the interest paid on my mortgage. Because I can save more money by paying extra towards the mortgage and not the auto loan.   Monthly Income : $4,707  Mortgage : $784.71 (but have been paying $850.10 from the beginning so lets use this number for DTI) Auto Loan : $380   DTI Ratio : 26.00%   Credit Card Debit: $250 (this is a comfortable payment, so yes I will be paying extra on this loan)  DTI with this loan: 30.06%  * I don't find it necessary to post my grocery, utility, or other \"bills\" that are not credit related. 557443 added on 10\/16\/09 > SAVINGS: --------- As of 10\/16\/2009 I have a total of $21,300 across 3 retirement accounts.  I save 5% of my paycheck for my 401(k).  I stopped a year ago on my Roth and IRA due to the market meltdown (it sucked to see your money vanish the day after you put it in). We had a $2,000 emergency savings fund until a month ago where a family emergency had hit but did not involve my household family members.  You help people out so when you need help one day, they'll help you. We only have each other in this world and no one else. 557443 added on 10\/16\/09 > REASON FOR THE DEBIT: ----------------------- Within the last year I've been really busy with work and just trying to keep up with life.  We had a birth of a beautiful little girl and my first son started kindergarten, so unexpected\/ill planned expenses got the best of me due to me being too lazy to keep track of my spending register.\n\nIs this a high-risk or low-risk borrower?

I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store\/gas\/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br\/><br\/>My FICO:<br\/><br\/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br\/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br\/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br\/><br\/>Breakdown:<br\/><br\/>$18,000 total<br\/>(10,511 to pay off\/refi Lending Club)<br\/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br\/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br\/><br\/><br\/>Why 60 month term? <br\/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br\/><br\/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br\/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br\/><br\/>Is my job safe?<br\/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br\/><br\/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br\/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.  I have funds in reserves to cover me should anything happen to my job.  I have a low debt to income ratio (20-26%).  I have no mortgage or rent.  I have inclining income, stable job, AND residence.  Last and certainly not least, I have perfect pay history with all lenders, MOST IMPORTANTLY, with Lending Club.  I have never been late on any payments on any debt...ever.  <br\/><br\/>More questions? Fire them away.  <br\/><br\/>Thanks for investing in me and helping me achieve my financial goals.<br\/> Borrower added on 08\/24\/11 > Faxed up all paystubs and W2. - Thanks.<br\/> Borrower added on 08\/26\/11 > Any questions from any hesitant investors?<br\/> Borrower added on 08\/27\/11 > FICO showing 750-780 on your end because I paid off and closed out WFFNB\/EXPRESS and WFNNB Victoria's Secrets.

The profit from my last investment is covering the down payment, fixing up, tenant acquisition and closing costs on the new property so I am in the clear to purchase.

I have the cash on hand to do so in my family's emergency fund; however that would leave us with no real financial cushion for the next 6 months.  My wife and I make $85-$100k a year depending on bonuses and have very little personal debt. ($250 car payment, $200 student loans for MBA, $1200 Mortgage PITI, $600 recurring bills, and $700 food living etc) and we pay off our credit cards at the end of the month.  In addition to our monthly cash flow, we will have the emergency cash on hand...so making payments will not be a problem at all.  I am requesting this loan to cover the security deposit (or replenish the emergency fund depending on timing) and will payback the loan as soon as the deposit is liquid.

{"prompt":"Loan Application:\nAmount: $13800\nTerm: 60 months\nInterest Rate: 11.86%\nAnnual Income: $108804\nCredit Rating: B\nDTI: 9.51\nEmployment Length: 1 year\nDescription: Borrower added on 06\/17\/10 > Purpose of Loan:  This loan will be used to consolidate and pay down high interest rate credit card balances (balances accruing interest between 22% - 28%).  Using these funds to consolidate my debt will result in lower consolidated monthly cash outflow versus the multiple credit card payments, and more importantly, will result in immediate monthly interest expense savings of approximately $140.  This loan will in no way add to my monthly cash outflow, in fact it will reduce it, and at the same time, it will save me on interest expense charges.<br\/><br\/>I have no intention to use the loan proceeds for discretionary spending. It will be used to payoff credit card balances.  I have no cash flow issues.  On a monthly basis, any excess cash I earn that does not go towards nondiscretionary spending, is mostly used to pay down debt. I am on an aggressive debt reduction plan, and this is just a step in meeting that goal.  I project that I will easily be able to payoff this loan well before the 60 month term if I choose to.  In fact, I will likely be able to pay this loan off within 24 months if I so decide (which is likely).  I am only requesting 60 months to give me flexibility in managing payments.  I hope to be consumer-debt free within 2 to 2.5 years.  I earn an annual gross income of $108,800, with a maximum bonus potential of 25.5% which is paid out in November each year.  For my fiscal year 2010 bonus, I am currently tracking at 22.5% (with a worst-case scenario being 19%).  I will be using my bonus (anticipated to be between $13k to 16k after tax) to continue to pay down my consumer debt.  Additionally, I project an income tax refund in March 2011 of approximately $7k to 9k (I have received $8K+ in tax refund each of the last two years and I project this to be the case in 2011), which will also used to pay down debt.<br\/><br\/>I would like to add that my current credit card debt situation is a result of a brief window of time about 5 years ago during which I was between employment for 3 months and I suffered a medical injury that required repeated surgeries to my knee without medical insurance coverage.  I have an accounting degree and, although I currently find myself with a bit of credit card debt, I am otherwise good will managing my finances.  I have NEVER been late for a payment, and have NEVER been delinquent on any debt. I have NEVER filed for bankruptcy, and I take pride in paying on time, in full and fulfilling any obligations I may have.<br\/><br\/>Also, I work in the Accounting\/Finance field for a well established and profitable company. The company I work for is making record profits, and did so even in the recession.  I have a secure job and I am in fact up for promotion in the next few months.  I have been with this company for about 20 months.  <br\/><br\/>Monthly Budget: <br\/>Cash Inflow:<br\/>$5,860 take home income per month (Note, monthly take home does not include expected annual cash inflows representing after-tax bonus of $14,000 (November time frame) and Income Tax Refund of $8,500 (March time frame):<br\/><br\/>Cash Outflow:<br\/>$1,200 credit card payments (before above requested loan)<br\/>$1757 Mortgage Payments<br\/>$195 Homeowners association fee<br\/>$350 Electric\/cable\/Heating bill<br\/>$100 Phone<br\/>$103 Car insurance<br\/>$180 Auto Gas<br\/>$200 Food<br\/><br\/>Balance of monthly take-home spend remaining for discretionary spending, savings, or excess principal payments on debt: $1,775<br\/><br\/>Thank you for your consideration and for investing!<br\/>\n\nIs this a high-risk or low-risk borrower?

I'm currently consulting on various small businesses that are taking their business online to maximize their sales.  ABOUT STARTUPSNAX:  StartupSnax.com, the provider of Daily Munchables for  Your Business, is a small business resource site centered around providing current and edgy content for the web 2.0\/social media & networking entrepreneurial environment and to help anyone looking for a current site to find information on how to start their business cost-effectively (how about under $10,000?), time-efficiently (maybe in a matter of weeks?) and resourcefully (how do I make sure my business is green?).  WHAT DO WE OFFER?  With the resources of the industries keynote authors on various topics, we will be offering:  - StartupSnax Blog - StartupSnax Free Stuff! - StartupSnax Ebook Store - StartupSnax RSS Feed and Newsletter  The authors of these ebooks are major industry writers that will be using their current substantial sales platforms (their websites, speaking engagements, newsletters, radio events, online blogs and webinars, book signings, and various other PR opportunities, etc) to direct traffic towards our site in addition to our online marketing, SEO and online traffic efforts. They will be using the site as a marketing vehicle for their various works and expertise.   HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?  Ebooks:  Ebooks have been increasing in YTD (past year to date) sales more than any other product in the publishing industry! Publishers Weekly (www.PublishersWeekly.com) has been quoting that although various in-store sales have been down over previous YTD sales, ebooks have been continuing to increase with the lowest overhead and highest profit margins! Better yet, trade ebook sales (business, not fiction) have been doing well despite the hardcopies' decrease in sales due to the economic slump.  Fortunately, since we are only offering these professionally-edited, written and designed ebooks in digital format, we are saving the cost of printing them, and staying GREEN as well!  By offering smaller (snackable!) ebooks in a condensed format by major authors similar to the Cliff Notes for small business and offering these ebooks at an impressive price point of less than $10, by maximizing traffic, we are sure of substantial ebook sales numbers based upon industry trends.   Ad Sales:  We have not calculated the inevitable ad revenue that will be garnered from providing a pivotal ebook store and resource site into our breakeven analysis but it is a buffer to ensure that we are profitable in the first two months.  WHY DO YOU NEED A LOAN?  A loan is a buffer for guaranteed success. Each person and company should have an emergency fund of at least three months' worth of working capital especially in this economy. Although we could  launch without a loan, although difficult, we are ensuring the success of a solid business plan in the case of a substantial interest in the company at the launch and the need for fast growth.  My credit is exceptional and this is not my only form of income since I'm also consulting, but I always advise my clients that cash is king! In the effort to keep the marketing budget at its peak, I need a loan to ensure those efforts. Also, the ebooks are being professionally copyedited and designed for ideal quality and I'm utilizing an industry leader as a production editor.  WHAT CAN I SEE NOW?  You can view the parked page at www.StartupSnax.com.  Our blog goes live mid November with a final site launch slated for January 1st!\n\nIs this a high-risk or low-risk borrower?

We own a 1994 Pontiac Bonneville and it has 258,000 miles on it. I use it to go to work and for local short runs. I live 3 miles from my work place. We also have a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee that has 216,000 miles on it. My wife uses it for her work and we use it for travel. Needless to say we are in need of a &quot;lesser mileage&quot; vehicle. The two cars we have are still going to be used until they die. Thus putting work miles on them, instead of a newer car.<br\/><br\/>The monthly payout for my credit card debts I want to consolidate with my current Lending Club debt is around $320.00. I've been doing this for some time and I ALWAYS have sent more the the required amount to each credit card working on getting the debt down. But, we are in need of a newer vehicle so I figure the payment on this loan will be in the same ballpark as to want I paying now so it should not be anymore of a strain on my current monthly payout.<br\/><br\/>I THINK I've got this figured out pretty good for my families financial well being but if there is anything you can suggest or recommend I'd be more than grateful to consider your thoughts.<br\/><br\/>Also, we do have a car in mind that a workmate of mine has for sale and it is in mint condition.

This comes out to approx $36, 358.00. I need to tell you that I work overtime just about every week. My income so far this year is $45,673.00 for weeks up to 10\/18\/2010.

I am not. I've not been late with a payment to any of my creditors for at least 12 years ( may be even more ) and this loan payment will not add any further burden to my monthly output. (See explanation above.)<br\/><br\/>I wanted to make this clear as I'm in fear that this loan might not go to full 100% funding as the funds just seem to be &quot;trickling&quot; in. I have a long way to go in only 9 days!  I'd hate to think that you did not invest with my loan because of my reported lower earnings than what I actually am making. I reported my &quot;regular&quot; earnings, but I make more than this with my &quot;overtime&quot; earnings.

He has always put us first, and being that we have three children, he has put them and their interest first for so long.  Since we got married so young, we were unable to buy a nice wedding ring set for either one of us, and now that we have been together for over 10years, he really wants to buy me a nice wedding ring set.

The amount of this loan represents the sum total of all of my debt. I've been carrying a balance for many years and am finally trying to just get it paid off. If you invest in my debt you WILL see a return. I would much rather pay a reasonable interest rate back to some honest individual investors than the 15%-20% I've been paying back to the banks for a long time. I've got a strong credit history with no delinquency...if they saw their money then you will most certainly see yours. <br\/><br\/>I am also in very stable employment. I work for the largest REIT in the U.S.- Equity Residential (ticker= EQR) as a property manager in the SF Bay Area which is a market they are continuing to grow in. I've worked there for 2.5 years now- I don't plan on going anywhere, and I don't believe Equity will be either.<br\/><br\/>I earn a modest but comfortable salary- plenty enough to afford the monthly requirement for this loan- just not enough to pay off $8500+ in debt so quickly at 15-20% interest every month. I don't have a lot of other expenses- I'm single, no kids, my car is paid for, and I rent an apartment with a roommate. Paying this off is my singular financial focus and will be until it is done.

In any case, I have arranged the travel for the final piece of this project and need additional capital to pay for one more softswitch, which I will dismantel and carry with me to India in my carry on luggage.

I can pay this and all of my unsecured debt off within 12 months upon the activation of this route.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n\nIs this a high-risk or low-risk borrower?

The debt is left over from a time when I was on a medical leave of absence, maintaining 2 homes so that I could receive treatment in another town. The interest rates on my cards are high so it just seems like I will never get them paid down.<br\/><br\/>5. I do intend to close the accounts once they are paid off and become a cash only consumer.

Your consideration of my loan is much appreciated.<br\/> Borrower added on 06\/08\/11 > My monthly gross income is approx. $3400 a month.
